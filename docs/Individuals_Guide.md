# PAIX for Individuals

**A Shared Smart Email Protocol for You and Your Personal AI**

---

## What is PAIX?

PAIX makes your email smarter and shared â€” between you and your personal AI.

- You already use email everywhere: to sign up, confirm, reset, and communicate
- Services already support email â€” it's the first and last thing they ask for
- There are 4.6 billion email users worldwide with 7.9 billion addresses

ðŸ‘‰ **PAIX doesn't replace email. It upgrades it into a shared universal interface â€” used by both you and your AI on your side.**

## Why it matters

The internet wasn't built for your personal AI.

- **Browsers are for humans**, not for AIs
- **APIs are for businesses**, not for individuals

PAIX upgrades email into a shared universal interface, so you and your AI can act together from the same channel.

- Always works as email
- Smarter when services recognize it
- Shared with your AI, so it can help you in the background

## The Golden Model

One PAIX address looks like this:
```
u7fw9s.k_3PZ9Q4F7G2@paix.prifina.com
```

It can act as:

- **Your ID** (unique per service)
- **A verified email** (trusted, not fake)
- **Passwordless login** (no more passwords)
- **Shared comms** (you + your AI together)
- **API key** (for structured automation)
- **AI interface** (so your AI can talk directly)
- **Optional verified credentials** (e.g. "verified adult" without exposing your birthday)

ðŸ‘‰ **At minimum, it's just email. But with PAIX, it's a shared identity + shared inbox + shared interface for you and your AI.**

## What you can do with PAIX

### 1. You â†” Services

- Use your PAIX address instead of personal email
- Sign up, log in, and receive updates as usual
- Cleaner, safer, and more private

### 2. Your AI â†” Services

- Let your AI update subscriptions, confirm addresses, collect receipts, or remind you of deadlines
- Because you share the same address, your AI can act in the same channel as you â€” not on the outside

### 3. Your AI â†” Other People's AIs

- Share your PAIX with friends, family, or colleagues
- Their AIs and your AI can coordinate schedules, share info, or negotiate small tasks â€” with you in the loop
- A shared-to-shared connection â€” each side rooted in its owner, but able to collaborate safely

### 4. You â†” Providers

- Choose your provider (Prifina is the first, others will follow)
- Switch providers or even use your own domain for absolute control
- Providers decide which features are technically supported (e.g. verified credentials, API key, AI interface)
- You decide per-address which of those features to enable when sharing a PAIX email with a service
- Services can check which features are active via a standard query, so there's never confusion

## Why this is safe

- **Always works as email** â†’ nothing breaks
- **You stay in control** â†’ revoke or rotate anytime
- **Your AI only acts within your rules** â†’ critical actions always need your confirmation
- **Trusted providers** â†’ services can check if an address is verified, without seeing your raw data

## Getting started

**Start simple:** use a PAIX address as your email with a service.

**Your AI can begin** reading and acting on messages with you.

**Over time, enable more features:** verification, automation, AI-to-AI collaboration.

ðŸ‘‰ **Adoption is gradual. You choose the pace.**

## Real-World Example

## Delivery Options

When you get a PAIX address, you can choose how to receive messages:

**Shared IMAP**
- Both you and your AI access the same inbox
- Perfect for collaboration and automation
- Your AI can read, summarize, and act on messages

**Forwarding**
- PAIX messages are forwarded to your existing email
- Keep using your current email app
- Your AI still gets a copy to help you

**Both**
- Use both delivery methods together
- Maximum flexibility and convenience

## Privacy & Control

- No cross-tracking between services
- Each relationship gets its own address
- Easy to see who's emailing you
