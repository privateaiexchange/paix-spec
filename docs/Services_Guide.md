# PAIX for Services

**A Shared Smart Email Protocol for Your Customers and Their AIs**

---

## What is PAIX?

PAIX makes email smarter and shared â€” between a customer and their personal AI.

- Every service already uses email. It's how you sign users up, send notifications, confirm identities, and close accounts
- There are 4.6 billion people using email globally, across 7.9 billion addresses

ðŸ‘‰ **PAIX doesn't replace email. It upgrades it into a shared universal interface â€” used by both the customer and their AI, on their side.**

## Why it matters for services

The internet wasn't built for your customers' AIs.

- **APIs are expensive to build**, inconsistent, and not available for every feature
- **Browsers are designed for humans**, not agents

PAIX fixes this by letting you use the same email channel you already rely on â€” but now shared with your customers' AIs.

- Always works as plain email
- Smarter when you recognize PAIX addresses
- Lets your service communicate with the customer and their AI through a single, shared channel

## The Golden Model

A PAIX address looks like this:
```
u7fw9s.k_3PZ9Q4F7G2@paix.provider.com
```

For you as a service, this single address can serve as:

- **Unique ID** (no cross-tracking issues)
- **Verified email** (not a fake signup)
- **Passwordless login credential** (works with OTP/magic links)
- **Shared inbox** (customer + AI receive it together)
- **Scoped API key** (embedded connect key for structured automation)
- **AI interface** (so your service AI can talk directly with theirs)
- **Optional verified credentials** (age, residency, or "identity confirmed," without exposing raw data)

ðŸ‘‰ **At minimum, it's just an email address. At maximum, it's a complete customer channel: ID + login + comms + automation + verification, in one.**

## What you can do with PAIX

### 1. Customer â†” Service

- Customers use PAIX addresses instead of personal emails
- **Cleaner onboarding:** fewer fakes, fewer dead accounts
- You treat it as email â€” no new infra needed

### 2. Customer AI â†” Service

- If a customer has a PAIX address, you can assume they also have a personal AI
- Your service can automate directly with their AI: update details, confirm renewals, send receipts, or notify of changes
- Their AI can handle routine requests without your support team

### 3. Service AI â†” Customer AI

Your AI and the customer's AI can connect directly through PAIX.

**Examples:**
- Request updated payment or billing info
- Confirm address changes
- Proactively notify of new features or contract terms
- Verify KYC attributes without exposing raw data

**Result:** Faster, cheaper, and less error-prone than human email or UI support.

### 4. Providers & Features

- Each PAIX address comes from a provider
- Providers decide which features are technically supported (verified credentials, API key, AI interface)
- Users decide per-address which of those features to enable when they share a PAIX email with your service
- You can query an address in a standard way (via a special-format email) to learn what features are available and active for that address
- This ensures transparency: you know exactly what you can rely on, without guessing or storing unnecessary data

## Business Benefits

### Reduced Support Costs
- AI-to-AI communication handles routine requests
- Fewer human support tickets
- Automated account updates and confirmations

### Improved Data Quality
- Verified email addresses reduce fake signups
- Provider authentication guarantees real users
- Cleaner customer database

### Enhanced Customer Experience
- Faster response times through AI automation
- Proactive notifications and updates
- Seamless account management

### Future-Proof Infrastructure
- Built on email standards you already use
- Gradual adoption with no breaking changes
- AI-ready from day one

## Why this is safe

- **Always works as email** â†’ zero breakage, zero risk in trying
- **Customer remains in control** â†’ AI only acts within their rules
- **Human-in-the-loop** â†’ critical actions always need user confirmation
- **You choose the level of support** â†’ from treating it as plain email, to enabling structured AI-to-AI automation
- **Provider trust** â†’ you can decide which providers you recognize, ensuring messages come from reliable sources

## Adoption path

### Level 0: Do Nothing
**Effort:** Zero  
**Benefit:** PAIX addresses work like regular email

Your existing email infrastructure handles PAIX addresses automatically.

### Level 1: Recognition
**Effort:** 5 minutes  
**Benefit:** Reduce fake signups, improve data quality

```python
def is_paix_address(email):
    return email.count('@') == 1 and '@paix.' in email

if is_paix_address(customer_email):
    # Apply premium routing or verification
    handle_verified_customer(customer_email)
```

### Level 2: Capability Discovery
**Effort:** 30 minutes  
**Benefit:** Know what features are available

Send a capability query email to discover what the customer's PAIX address supports.

### Level 3: Automation
**Effort:** 2-4 hours  
**Benefit:** Enable AI-to-AI communication

Process structured action requests from customer AIs with appropriate security measures.

### Level 4: Full Integration
**Effort:** Days  
**Benefit:** Complete AI-service collaboration

Enable bi-directional AI communication with escalation to secure APIs when needed.

## Implementation Examples

### E-commerce Platform
```python
def handle_order_update(customer_paix_address, order_id, status):
    if supports_ai_interface(customer_paix_address):
        # Send structured update to customer's AI
        send_structured_notification(customer_paix_address, {
            "type": "order_update",
            "order_id": order_id,
            "status": status,
            "tracking_url": get_tracking_url(order_id)
        })
    else:
        # Fall back to regular email
        send_regular_email_notification(customer_paix_address, order_id, status)
```

### SaaS Application
```python
def process_subscription_change(customer_paix_address, new_plan):
    if requires_user_confirmation(new_plan):
        # Send OTP challenge
        send_otp_challenge(customer_paix_address, {
            "action": "upgrade_subscription",
            "new_plan": new_plan,
            "price_change": calculate_price_change(new_plan)
        })
    else:
        # Process automatically
        update_subscription(customer_paix_address, new_plan)
```

### Customer Support
```python
def handle_support_request(customer_paix_address, request):
    if can_automate_response(request):
        # Let AIs handle common requests
        send_ai_response(customer_paix_address, generate_response(request))
    else:
        # Route to human agent with PAIX context
        route_to_human_support(customer_paix_address, request, paix_context=True)
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Verify PAIX signatures for structured actions
- Check provider trust status
- Validate embedded connect keys (ECK)

### Authorization
- Respect user-defined AI permissions
- Require OTP for sensitive operations
- Maintain audit trails

### Privacy
- Handle verified credentials properly
- Don't store unnecessary customer data
- Respect selective disclosure preferences

## Getting Started

1. **Start Simple:** Recognize PAIX addresses in your existing email flow
